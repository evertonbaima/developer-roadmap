# Basic concepts

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes (from [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)).

### Builder

Provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation (from [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)).

### Factory method 

Uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor (from [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern)).

### Prototype

It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects (from [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern)).

### Singleton

Restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance (from [Wikipédia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)).
